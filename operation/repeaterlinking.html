    <h1>Connecting D-STAR Gateway Repeaters via Linking</h1>
    <p>
        A simple way of connecting two repeaters is to link them directly as 
        you would with a reflector. This allows users to respond via the usual 
        Gateway CQ configuration without needing to know the repeater or enter
        the callsign of the remote station.
    </p>
    <p>
        To do this, the UR field of the sending repeater needs to be set to
        the callsign of the receiving repeater with a <b>L</b> in the 8th 
        positon. For example, if you wanted to link to the <b>W8TST B</b> node, 
        you would enter <b>W8TST BL</b> in the UR field of your radio.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the repeater callsign were longer like WT8EST, you would need to
        omit the space, so you'd enter <b>WT8ESTL</b> in the UR field of your 
        radio.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once configured, you'd briefly send a transmission and if the link is 
        successful you should hear a message confirming the link.
    </p>
    <p>
        After linking successfully, set your radio to Gateway CQ mode. 
        Transmissions will be sent from your local gateway to the remote 
        gateway repeater and all stations listeing to either repeater will 
        hear the response, but only stations using Gateway CQ or 
        <a href="callsignrouting.html">callsign routing</a> will be able to 
        respond.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be sure to send the <b>Unlink</b> command "       U" (7 spaces followed 
        by a U in the 8th position) to unlink the repeaters when you are done. 
        If successful, you should hear a message confirming the unlink. Most
        repeaters will automatically unlink after a period of inactivity, but
        it's good practice to unlink when you are done.
    </p>
    <h2>Common Linking Errors</h2>
    <p>
        When attempting to link, sometimes you may hear a message indicating
        that the link is already in use. This means that someone else is
        already using the link. If you are sure that you are not interrupting
        a conversation, you can try again in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a user can't link to a repeater, they could also try 
        <a href="routing.html">original routing</a> but it's important to 
        inform listeners of the sending repeater and node so they can 
        reply, otherwise they'd need to use 
        <a href="callsignrouting.html">callsign routing</a>.
