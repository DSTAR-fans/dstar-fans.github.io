    <h1>Responding via a Gateway with D-STAR</h1>
    <p>
        One of the most powerful features of D-STAR is the ability to route
        transmissions based on the callsign of the destination. This allows
        you to communicate with a specific station, without knowing what
        repeater they are on. Unfortunately, this may not work with people
        using hotspots or repeaters with this feature disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Icom radios, there is often a dedicated [RX->CS] button. On
        Kenwood HT's the [ENT] button is used. After a Gateway station is
        heard, pressing and holding this button will allow you to set the
        TO field in your radio to their callsign. When you transmit, your
        transmission will be routed from your gateway repeater to theirs,
        based on the last gateway they used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing the RX→CS button again after the conversation is over 
        typically returns the radio to the previous settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be useful if you are scanning several repeaters and 
        didn't catch which repeater or module they were on, but still wish 
        to respond. It's also handy for reaching out to friends who may be 
        traveling. The users of both your gateway, and the remote gateway 
        will hear your response - regardless of whether or not your friend is 
        listening. Also, be aware that you may be interrupting a conversation
        on the other repeater, so be polite and keep your transmission short.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's also important to note the difference between local CQ and 
        gateway CQ while using gateway repeaters or reflectors. If you make
        a habit of using the Gateway CQ setting, your responses will be 
        shared with any Gateway linked repeaters or reflectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a modern Icom radio, this can easily be set in DV mode by 
        selecting <b>Reflector > Use Reflector</b> in the TO field. 
        If you open the Call Sign (CS) menu which reveals the 
        underlying UR, R1, R2, and MY settings from older radios, you'll see 
        that this sets the UR field to <b>CQCQCQ</b> and the R2 field to the 
        local repeater's gateway. For local CQ the R2 field is not used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Simply put, Gateway CQ sends to everyone connected via the Gateway,
        and Local CQ sends to everyone on the local repeater - but users 
        linked via the gateway cannot hear you. So, while it's not the 
        default CQ setting, it's best to make a habit of using Gateway CQ so 
        anyone you hear can hear you, then reserve Local CQ for when you need 
        to do a quick sidebar with someone on the local repeater without 
        sending it to everyone on the Gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
        If using routing features, it's a good idea to explain how they are 
        hearing you such as adding "via callsign routing" to the end of your 
        transmission, this should cue knowledgable uers that they'll need to 
        use the gateway to respond to you. Otherwise they could be responding 
        to everyone on the local repeater, but you won't hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also be careful using callsign routing while linked to 
        reflectors. If you hear someone on a reflector, and use callsign 
        routing to respond, the response will not be heard on the reflector; 
        only on the Gateway repeaters used by you and the station you are 
        calling. If they're using a hotspot, they may not hear you at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Experienced D-STAR users often dismiss the feature altogether - but 
        used properly it is very convenient, but due to the popularity of 
        Local CQ in the US and the popularity of hotspots, it won't always
        help. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a similar <a href="routing.html">original routing</a> 
        technique that enables users to send transmissions to a specific 
        repeater and node. Callsign routing is often the easiest way to 
        respond to a call sent via this method.
