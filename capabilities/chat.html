    <h1>RS-MS1A Text Messaging Chat</h1>

    <h2>How to Text Message Chat with other D-STAR users</h2>
    <p>
        Chatting is made possible via the RS-MS1A Android app (and the RS-MS1I app for iOS devices).
        D-STAR capable devices that can connect to these apps via cable or Bluetooth data connection will be able to use this capability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Android users can choose from the widest variety of radios and connection methods.
        The list includes 12 radios (as of this writing), four of them Bluetooth capable.
        For the full list of radios and connection methods, as they evolve over time, check the
        <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1A/#:~:text=Function%20Comparison%20Chart" target="_blank">Function Comparison Chart</a> on the RS-MS1A page of Icom website.
    </p>
    <p>
        iOS users can choose from 3 radios (as of this writing), all of them Bluetooth.
        For the full list of radios and connection methods, as they evolve over time, check the
        <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1I/#:~:text=Function%20Comparison%20Chart" target="_blank">Function Comparison Chart</a> on the RS-MS1I page of the Icom website.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have an IC-705 or ID-52, you can get started right now with the free app.
        For other radios, you may need to purchase a Bluetooth upgrade, or a data cable.
        While a little more expensive, I like the Bluetooth option because it allows you
        to access and control your radio from outside of your car, there's no cable to
        stow (and potentially lose or forget).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have the app connected to your supporting radio, simply navigate to the Text Messaging section of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select a reciever from the list, enter a message, and press Transmit.
    </p>
    <p>
        A short RF burst will send your message to radios listening via simplex, local repeater, or even via a reflector.
