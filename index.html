    <h1>ðŸ—¼D-STAR Fans</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <a href="https://DSTAR.fans">DSTAR.fans</a>, a site for fans of <a href="http://www.icomamerica.com/en/products/amateur/dstar/dstar/default.aspx" target="_blank">D-STAR</a>!</p>

    <h2 id="qsoParty2022">D-STAR QSO PARTY 2022</h2>
    <h3>The event has ended!</h3>
    <p>
        This global event is back after three years hiatus and is set to take place over the holiday period from<br />
        <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/event/dqp/" target="_blank">2022-12-28 00:00 UTC - 2023-01-03 23:59 UTC</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose was to encourage <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/D-STAR" target="_blank">D-STAR</a> operators
        to communicate with as many other operators worldwide but also to encourage the picture-sending function found in
        the latest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-STAR" target="_blank">D-STAR</a> radios.
    </p>
    <p>
        Results will be announced on March 1st, 2023
    </p>

    <h2 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started / First Steps</h2>
    <p>
        The very first thing to do when working with D-STAR is to configure your station values.  
        These include your call sign in the <b>MY</b> value on your radio (including a short suffix), and a message.
        With D-STAR, every transmission includes your call-sign, so even a quick "<a href="https://www.k0nr.com/wordpress/2012/12/proper-kerchunking/" target="_blank">kerchunk</a>" on the air, 
        repeater, or reflector will be sent to other D-STAR users who will be able to see this info in their RX history log.
    </p>
    <p>
        With D-STAR, this can be very handy because some radios include text-to-speech functions 
        that announce the call-sign of transmissions too short to include the call-sign in a voice transmission. 
        Also, if a listener is not focused on the radio at the moment a transmission is recieved, they can go back and see who was calling.
    </p>
    <p>
        When operators make a QSO they <a href="http://www.roblocher.com/whitepapers/dstar.html" target="_blank">start</a> with their call sign, and often report on signal strength, their location, and equipment used. 
        After setting your call sign, D-STAR makes it easy to share some of this other info as well. 
        Most D-STAR radios support a "suffix" which is a 4-character value following a slash at the end of the call-sign.  
        The convention is to enter the model number of your radio such as <b>/92AD</b>, <b>/52A</b>, or <b>/5100</b>. 
        This will make it easy for those familiar with these radios to understand your hardware capabilities - such as sending and recieving images.
        Some sites with <a href="http://dstarinfo.com/first-steps.aspx" target="_blank">D-STAR Info on First Steps</a> advise putting your name in the suffix â€“ 
        but this only works for people with four-letter-word names and shorter.
        You can also look at <a href="https://www.dstar.guru/#most-used-suffix-of-the-year" target="_blank">reflector statistics</a> to get an idea 
        of the popularity of different radio hardware and modes being used on D-STAR and see how others are using this feature.
        Some suffixes like <b>/DMR</b> or <b>/PNUT</b> refer to cross-mode links or software being used to access the D-STAR system instead of a radio.
    </p>
    <p>
        While location data can be <a href="/index.html#dprs" target="_self">shared from GPS</a>, oparators often use the TX Message value to share their name and general location, 
        keeping in mind that via reflectors, people anywhere in the world might see this message.  
        One example might be "<i>Mark in Galena, Ohio</i>" keeping in mind that there is a 20 character limit on the message field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many radios allow several call signs and messages to be stored allowing them to be changed frequently to reflect the user's current status.
        This can allow a great deal of information to be sent with brief kerchunks or long-winded ragchew transmissions just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        One might think themselves clever to enter some made-up value as their call-sign on D-STAR. 
        This is possible, but only valid call-signs may be used to access the network of D-STAR gateways. 
        Once registered with your local gateway, your call sign is your passport to the wider world, so it pays to ensure this value is set correctly from the start.
    </p>

    <h2 id="simplex">How to use D-STAR without a repeater</h2>
    <p>
        It's easy to make use of D-STAR without any repeaters or hotspots.  Start by setting your radio for 145.6700
        (the National 2m D-STAR Calling Frequency) and put your radio into DV mode. Just key the mic and you're operating
        with D-STAR!
    </p>
    <p>Here are a few other frequencies to try:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>2m</th><th>70cm</th></tr>
        <tr><td>145.6000 DV</td><td>441.0000 DV</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>145.6700 DV (Calling)</b></td><td>445.6700 DV</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        D-STAR simplex operation allows you to:
        <ol>
            <li>Send your callsign with every transmission (though it's still advisable to ID via digital voice)</li>
            <li>
                Send <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1A/#:~:text=D%2DSTAR%20Stations%20and%20Repeater%20Sites%20Mapping" target="_blank">
                    your location if GPS is enabled
                </a>, or the GPS coordinates are programmed into your base station (great for pointing directional antennas)
            </li>
            <li>
                Sending <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1A/#:~:text=or%20DV%20mode.-,Share%20Pictures,-Share%20Pictures%20Example" target="_blank">
                    pictures
                </a> via mobile devices or transferred to a supporting radio via memory card (you can even talk while you transmit)
            </li>
            <li>
                Send <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1A/#:~:text=mode%20(with%20voice).-,Text%20Messaging,-Text%20Messaging%20Example" target="_blank">
                    short text messages
                </a> along with each transmission, as well as host text chats using the
                <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1A/" target="_blank">RS-MS1A</a> or
                <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1I/" target="_blank">RS-MS1I</a> apps.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        With a supported radio and these apps, one can unlock some really neat features like <a href="/capabilities/chat.html" target="_self">Text Messaging chats</a>.

        most D-STAR network traffic is from people that aren't using D-STAR capable radios.  For example, when the site
        listed 10,818 D-STAR users per month, when I filtered the non-radio suffixes the numbers were more like 9,940 D-STAR
        users per year. I submitted feedback on these issues, maybe he'll improve it - or maybe we'll have time to submit a pull
        request since it's an Open Source project.

    <h2 id="gateways">Gateway Repeaters</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            If another station is using the Gateway feature of a repeater they should announce their source repeater (for example W8CMH B).
        </p>
        <p>
            That info allows you to set RPT1 and RPT2 to your local module and gateway, then set YOUR to /W8CMHâ–ªB (for the example above).
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most common mistakes is to try to speak to a Gateway user with YOUR set to CQCQCQ and no Gateway set. Only local repeater users will hear you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, most Icom radios have an RXâ†’CS button. Pressing it sets your radio to communicate directly with the last station heard.
            This takes the guess work out of configuring your radio for a quick reply.  Be sure to refer to your radio's manual for specifics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pressing the RXâ†’CS button again after the conversation is over typically returns the radio to your previous settings.

    <h2 id="memonics">D-STAR Call Sign Memonics</h2>
    <p>
        To help remind me which Call Sign (CS) value is which, I use these tricks to keep the values straight.
    </p>
    <p><b>YOUR</b> is where I put <b>YOUR</b> call sign, repeater, or reflector.</p>
    <p><b>RPT1</b> rhymes with <b>FROM</b>.</p>
    <p><b>RPT2</b> rhymes with <b>TO</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Beyond that, the main thing to remember is that <b>RPT2</b> must be set to a repeater Gateway to use features of D-STAR that make use of the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        It takes some practice, but hopefully these memonics will help.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dprs">D-PRS: How to share location with APRS users</h2>
    <p>
        APRS is a neat technology for sharing info on your QTH, or sharing your position while mobile. 
        Some use it when traveling off the grid to leave a trace of the route they ended up taking in the event of an emergency.
        Still others use APRS to commune with nearby hams.
    </p>
    <p>
        D-STAR transmissions contain location information where available (if the radio GPS is active and the feature is turned on), 
        so similar functionality is automatic among D-STAR users.  In the spirit of cross-compatibility though, the D-PRS feature was added; 
        allowing the D-STAR location information to be shared on the APRS network.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable this, all one needs to do is use the Gateway function to communicate with a D-PRS capable repeater.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can check your status on sites such as <a href="https://aprs.fi" target="_blank">APRS.fi</a> by searching for your call sign.
