        <h1>ðŸ—¼D-STAR Fans</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <a href="https://DSTAR.fans">DSTAR.fans</a>, a site for fans of <a href="http://www.icomamerica.com/en/products/amateur/dstar/dstar/default.aspx">D-STAR</a>!</p>

        <h2>Simplex Frequencies</h2>
        <p>It's easy to make use of D-STAR without any repeaters or hotspots.  Start by setting your radio for 145.6700 (the National 2m D-STAR Calling Frequency) and put your radio into DV mode. Just key the mic and you're operating with D-STAR!</p>
        <p>Here are a few other frequencies to try:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>2m</th><th>70cm</th></tr>
                <tr><td>145.6000 DV</td><td>441.0000 DV</td></tr>
                <tr><td><b>145.6700 DV (Calling)</b></td><td>445.6700 DV</td></tr>
            </table>
        <p>D-STAR simplex operation allows you to:
            <ol>
                <li>Send your callsign with every transmission (though it's still advisable to ID via digital voice)</li>
                <li>Send your location if GPS is enabled, or the GPS coordinates are programmed into your base station (great for pointing directional antennas)</li>
                <li>Sending pictures via mobile devices or transferred to a supporting radio via memory card (you can even talk while you transmit)</li>
                <li>Send short text messages along with each transmission, as well as host text chats using the <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1A/">RS-MS1A</a> or <a href="https://www.icomjapan.com/lineup/options/RS-MS1I/">RS-MS1I</a> apps.</li>
            </ol>
