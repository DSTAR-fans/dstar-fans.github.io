    <h1>Responses</h1>
    <div class="content-item">
    <h2>RPT?</h2>
    <p>This response is typically seen when the repeater does not recognize 
        what was sent as a valid callsign routing command. 
        This indicates normal repeater operation and if when using a repeater 
        or reflector, can be treated as a response indicating that the station
        was heard, similar to the beep response of a traditional FM repeater.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-item">
    <h2>UR?</h2>
    <p>
        The UR? response in D-STAR means that your signal reached the access 
        repeater and your call was successfully sent from the destination 
        repeater. This confirms that your transmission was received by 
        the system. You should get a reply call from the station you are trying 
        to contact, or hear other stations on the reflector you are linked to. 
        If you do not get a UR? response, it means that your signal did not 
        reach the access repeater, or the destination repeater did not recognize 
        your call sign. You may need to check your settings (starting with 
        <a href="/index.html#registration">verifying your registration</a> if you 
        have not yet done so) or try a different repeater or reflector.
